# Mosaic Tetris
Mosaic Tetris is a Tetris variant where you can put the tetrominos anywhere and they don't fall down, but you can't rotate them.

This is my first ever program written in Go!

It's called Mosaic Tetris because you're laying down tetrominos like tiles in a mosaic.

## Controls
* Move up/left/down/right: arrow keys
* Hard drop: space
